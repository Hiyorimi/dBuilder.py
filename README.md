# dBuilder.py

dBuilder.py is smart contract development framework in Python for TON. It's goal is to make the development, testing, and deployment processes a lot easier!

## Goals
- Be an easy-to-use full-stack python framework for building on TON ecosystem
- Provide standard contract implementations (similar to OpenZeppelin)
- Utilize Python’s syntax capabilities to provide code reusing, readable and structured code that’s easy to test.

## Roadmap

### Milestone 1: Python Framework for contract development

- [x] Semi One-to-One mapping of functions and expressions (Base Compiler, Python -> FunC)
- [ ] First higher layer over the base mappings to simplify type calls (leveraging OOP capabilities)
- [ ] Second higher layer over the base, simplifying contract developments towards maximizing code reusability and simplicity (leveraging Meta programming capabilities)
- [ ] Providing standard smart contracts implementation with dBuilder

### Milestone 2: deploying, testing, interaction capabilities
- [ ] Simple interaction interface with TON Blockchain
- [ ] Simple deploying options of developed contracts
- [ ] Testing framework for the contracts developed with dBuilder

## Supporters

Special Thanks to TON Society for supporting the project and providing the grant, which without it the project wouldn't be possible.
