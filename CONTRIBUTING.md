# Contributing to Rift

ðŸŽ‰ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰

Following these standards shows that you value the time of the developers that created and are developing this open source project.
In response, they should show you respect by addressing your issue, reviewing adjustments, and assisting you in finalizing your pull requests.

Rift is an open source framework, and we welcome community contributions!
Writing tutorials or blog entries, enhancing the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, or writing code that can be incorporated into rift itself are all ways to contribute.

## Prerequisite
When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make by issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue.
Any security issues should be submitted directly to 
security@skyring.io In order to determine whether 
you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself this question:

Does the framework's base implementations lead to a generated FunC Smart Contract that has security vulnerabilities?

If the answer is "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue.
Note that even if you answer "no" to the question,
you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at security@skyring.io

## Feature Request
